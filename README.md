Common functions for interacting with Microstack products.

Contains some core helper functions and pure Python drivers for accessing
GPIO pins, SPI and I2C buses.

Currently in active development. Still need to experiment with SMBus for
Python 3.

You will also need to set up automatic loading of the SPI kernel module which
can be done with the latest version of `raspi-config`. Run:
